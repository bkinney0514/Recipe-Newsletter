            shallow bowl and mix well.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken cutlet in the breadcrumb mixture and place them on the sheet pan. Be sure to discard the
            breadcrumb mixture afterwards!</li>
        <li>Once the oven is heated up, bake the chicken for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the chicken over and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the oven, but don't turn the oven off yet! Starting with the sauce, add sauce and
            mozzarella cheese to each cutlet.</li>
        <li>Bake for another 7-10 minutes until the cheese melts.</li>
        <li>Serve on its own or with your favorite side dish, and enjoy!</li>
